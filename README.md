# Dungeon Days site

## Local Dev

Do this:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Edit page content in `./src/pages/`
Some of the pages use components which are made in the `./src/components/` folder

## Building

Do this:

```
npm run build
```

You'll need to make sure the build files aren't excluded from git via `.gitignore`
You may need to amend github pages to point at the new folder generated by the build step

## TODO

- [] Use the right fonts
- [] Tweak the typography
- [] Create some new images for the stories which are a bit nicer
- [] Add some of the background content images?
- [] Reinstate the Google analytics stuff (@Ollie - you can do this in `src/components/Layout.astro`)
- [] Reinstate some of the links to emails etc (see `src/pages/index.astro`)

Astro JS (ftw): https://astro.build/
Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/
